  "example_result": "Based on the available content, here is a summarized version of the article about Coronavirus in bullet points:\n- Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds.\n- In humans, coronaviruses can lead to respiratory tract infections, which can range from mild, like some cases of the common cold, to severe, such as SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.\n- The name \"coronavirus\" is derived from the Latin word \"corona,\" meaning \"crown\" or \"halo,\" which refers to the characteristic appearance of the virus particles.\n- Coronaviruses have a genome composed of a single strand of RNA and have characteristic surface spike proteins.\n- They are classified within the family Coronaviridae and the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae.\n- These viruses are further grouped into four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus.\n- Transmission between humans typically occurs through respiratory droplets, especially from coughs and sneezes.\n- Major outbreaks in recent history include the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and COVID-19 starting in late 2019.\n\nNow, let's use the above summary to generate an audio file using the ElevenLabs MCP and the 'Rachel' voice. The audio file has been successfully generated using the 'Rachel' voice. You can find the file saved on your desktop under the name tts_Coron_20251029_145539.mp3.",
